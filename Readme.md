# Chat commands Parser

The theme of the parcer is a command like input in the enviroment like chats of different social apps (Discord, Telegram)
It parces users input-commands in format: /command_name|identifier (arguments)*

I had problems understanding how to work with Makefile

This application is a parser built with Rust using the `pest`. It takes command-line input, parses it and displays structured information about the input.
